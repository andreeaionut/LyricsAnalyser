Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
(take you anywhere)
But I love you endlessly
(loving we will share)
So come and go with me
To one town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover,
You know, don't you remember
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)
It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah
Oh oh oh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear the creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, oh
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terrors on the screen
I'll make you see
That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause it's a thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ohh baby (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night (Thriller night)
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't want to see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't want to see no blood, don't be a macho man
You want to be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you want to be bad
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't want to be a boy, you want to be a man
You want to stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you,
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you want to be bad
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or who's right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice, don't think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one,
(You know what you did, (she says he is my son)breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do it that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why why
(That way) Why why
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, cha cha cha cha cha cha
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, ooo tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, da da da da da da da da
Why does he do my that way, I like living this way
Why, oh why, why, why
Where did you come from lady
And ooh won't you take me there
Right away won't you baby
Tendoroni you've got to be
Spark my nature
Sugar fly with me
Don't you know now
Is the perfect time
We can make it right
Hit the city lights
Then tonight ease the lovin' pain
Let me take you to the max
I want to love you 
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
I want to love you
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
Nothin' can stop this burnin'
Desire to be with you
Gotta get to you baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin'
Honey, come set me free
Don't you know now is the perfect time
We can dim the lights
Just to make it right
In the night
Hit the lovin' spot
I'll give you all that I've got
I want to love you 
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
I want to love you 
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
Pretty young things, repeat after me
I said,
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na
I said na na na na na
Na na na na na
I'll take you there
I want to love you
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
I want to love you
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady our love will shine
Lighting the night
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise
Now is the time girl
You're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away
So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And baby through the years
Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you'll always be the lady in my life
Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in the beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl
And I will keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And baby through the years
Even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life
Stay with me
I want you to stay with me

Your butt is mine, gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone, Shamone
Lay it on me, all right
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
I'm telling you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait til I get through

Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

[Verse 2]
The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait til I get through

[Verse 1]
I'm headed for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks?
Is he getting nearer?
I feel some heat is on my back

[Hook]
(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Doing it on the highway
Gotta have it my way

Mind is like a compass
I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon)

Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway
I gotta really burn this road

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said the future's in your hands, the life you save could be your own
You're preaching about my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like for me there's no tomorrow

[Interlude]
Go!
Go!
Go!
Aaow!

[Hook]
(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a leadway

Just pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
(Speed demon)
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
(Speed demon)
Just pull over, boy, and eat your ticket
Pull over, boy
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

When you have to say, "I do"
And I'll smile and say it, too
And forever will be true

[Outro]
I love you, Liberian girl
All the time
I love you, Liberian girl
All the time
I love you, Liberian girl
All the time
I love you, Liberian girl
All the time
I love you
I love you, baby

Ooh

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-nah!
Hoo-hoo! Dancin'-hee!
Doggone lover!
C'mon, boy

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
I watched you on the floor
Cheek to cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see, her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
(Before you make) Before you make
(A big mistake) Remember
That looks can fool you, babe (Hee!)
There's something I would sure appreciate
(If you can keep a secret)

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me–ooh)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
If they ask her
Tell 'em that we're just good friends
Dah! Chika-chika-chika-ah!
Just good friends
Ah! Chika-chika-ah! Ooo
(Doot-do-do-doo, hee! Aaow!)
Just good friends

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder, Stevie & Michael]
You better take advice
Never trust first impressions
I tried to hide this affair
From their suspicions
So even if she's asking you to stay
You better know where you stand

[Refrain: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me–ooh)

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
Now if they ask you
Jus' tell 'em that we're just good friends
Yes, just good friends
(Just good friends)
Root-do-do-do
(Doot-do-do-do)
(Just good friends)

[Bridge: Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Both]
Listen up, hee!
We've got a problem here
I can see the signs
I guess the lady is still making up her mind
Say: "We're just good friends" (Ohhh!)

[Refrain: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, though she never shows she cares
No, you won't see her kiss and hug me (Just good friends)
My baby loves me, though she acts like I'm not there
You doggone Lover, hee!
Aaow!
Don't you wanna know?

[Outro: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares (Hee! Hee!)
She doesn't kiss and hug me (Just good friends)
My baby loves me, she loves me, she loves me
Hee! Hee! Hee! Hoo! Hoo!
My baby loves me, baby
My baby's gon' stay there
My baby loves me
Baby loves me, baby loves me, ooh-ooh-ooh!

Na-na-na-na-na, ohhh yeah! (Just good friends)
Baby love me, don't she? Oh! (Oh!)
Don't even try it! (Hee-Hee)
[Verse 1]
We're taking over

To see it through
Don't point your finger
Not dangerous
This is our planet
You're one of us

[Chorus]
We're sending out
A major love

[Outro]
We're taking over
This is the truth, baby
Another part of me
[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
See the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

[Outro]
Woo, woo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana) woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, Shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to stop it yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, woo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, Shamone, Shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah) stand up (Make that change) stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Ow! (Yeah, make that change)
Make that change, Shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)

Make that change!
[Intro]
I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: "There's no turning back."
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Diana, Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana

[Verse 3]
She said: "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said: "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me
She said: "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said: "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key."
She said: "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Diana, Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana
[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Refrain]
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A Smooth Criminal

[Verse 2]
So they came in to the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

[Refrain]
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal

[Interlude]
Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

[Outro]
Annie, are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dag gone it)
Annie are you okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
There's a sound at the window (Dag gone it-baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment, (Dag gone it)
Left bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down (Dag gone it)
It was your doom Annie
[Intro]
Aaow!
Hoo-hoo!

[Verse 1]
I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walking begging back, mama
I don't care anyway
Time after time I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb baby
All is going my way

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing, baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughing, baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone–stop it!
Just stop dogging me around (just stop dogging me)

[Verse 2]
There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now?
You got a way of making me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walking, begging, I ain’t loving you
Don't you get in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing, baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughing, baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone–stop it!
Just stop dogging me around

[Pre-Chorus]
(There's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing, baby? Don't you know, girl
(There's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughing, baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone–stop it!
Just stop dogging me
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone–stop it!
Just stop dogging me around

[Outro]
Don't come begging me
Don't come begging
Don't come loving me
Don't come begging
I love you
I don't want it
I don't, I don't, I don't, I, aow!
Hee-hee!
Don't come begging me
Don't come begging
Don't come loving me
Don't come begging
I love you
I don't want it
I don't need it
