I found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone
Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see
That you give good love to me, baby
So good, take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
It's never too much
Baby, you give good love
Never stopping, I was always searching
For that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of
Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see
That you give good love to me, baby
So good, take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
It's never too much
Baby, you give good love
Now I can't stop looking around
It's not what this life's all about
Our love is here to stay, to stay
Baby, you give good love
So good
Take this heart of mine
Into your hands
You give good love to me
Never, never too much
No, no, no, no, no
You give good love to me
So good, so good
You give me good love
Good love, good love
Yeah, you do
You know what I need
I can't get you off my mind
No matter what I do
I'm wishing you were here with me
It makes no difference
I only think of you
And I'm living out my fantasy
Late at night, a rendezvous
Being such a love sick fool
It might be pouring rain (it could be pouring)
But still the same, nothing's changed
All in all I feel no shame
I'm just your fool the same
(I'm just your fool)
(I keep thinking about you, baby)
So tell me what you're gonna do
(I keep thinking about you)
All I wanna do is
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind)
(I'm thinking about you)
That's what I wanna do
(Pick me up, let's go down)
(I'm thinking about it, too)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I'm thinking about you)
Ya got me thinking about you
(I'm thinking about it, too)
Maybe weeping is a game
That's hard for me to face
(Don't you need me)
Just like I need you
There's no reason
Just my heart that makes me feel this way
And I hope you feel the same way, too
Late at night, a rendezvous
Being such a love sick fool
It might be pouring rain (it could be pouring)
But still the same, nothing's changed
All in all I feel no shame
I'm just your fool the same
I'm just your fool
(I keep thinking about you, baby)
So tell me what you're gonna do
Got me thinking about you
All I wanna do is
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind)
(I'm thinking about you)
That's what I wanna do
(Pick me up, let's go down)
(I'm thinking about it, too)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I'm thinking about you)
Got me thinking about you
(I'm thinking about it, too)
It might be pouring rain
But like a fool, insane
I run, I run, I run, I run to you
I'm just a love sick fool
I've got this thing for you
(I'm just, I'm just a love sick fool)
I'm just a fool for you
(I keep thinking about you, baby)
So tell me what you're gonna do
Got me thinking about you
All I wanna do is
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind)
(I'm thinking about you)
That's what I wanna do
(Pick me up, let's go down)
(I'm thinking about it, too)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I'm thinking about you)
Got me thinking about you
(I'm thinking about it, too)
That's what I wanna do
(Pick me up, let's go down)
(I'm thinking about it, too)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I'm thinking about you)
Got me thinking about you
I'm here alone on a Friday night
Waiting here beside the phone
The TV, radio and me
Really ain't been getting along
I wish that I could fly away
And party 'til the break of day
And there I'll be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me
Then mama comes and asks me
Why am I dreaming sitting alone?
Why not go out and have some fun
It's the only way I'll ever find
Someone for me
While I am young and seventeen
Someone for me
Someone for me
I've got to go find someone, someone
Someone for me
I've got to find someone, yeah
Now there's a party down at Angie's house
With people packed against the wall
I'm sitting in the corner here
Trying to make some sense of it all
And when I least expect it
Meeting the guy I see in my dreams
Here he is walking up to me and asking
If I'd like to come and dance with him
I think I've found someone for me
Someone for me
Someone for me
I've got to go find someone, someone
Someone for me
I've got to find someone
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me
Someone
And so I'm finding out that dreams you believe in
Can come to be
And now I'm looking up to find the joy and happiness
Can come to you and me
At last I've found someone for me
Someone for me
Someone for me
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me
Someone
Someone for me
Someone for me
Someone for me
Someone
Someone for me
Someone, someone, someone, someone, someone, someone for me
Someone for me
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, yeah yeah
Someone for me
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me
Someone
Someone for me
Someone for me
Someone for me
Someone
Someone for me
Someone, somebody, someone, somebody, someone, somebody for me
Someone for me
Someone, somebody, someone, someone for me
A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you
It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you
You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
For you
For you
Like a candle
Burning bright
Love is glowing in your eyes
A flame to light our way
That burns brighter everyday
But now I have you
Nobody loves me like you do
Like a leaf
Upon the wind
I could find no place to land
I dream the hours away
And wonder everyday
Do dreams come true?
Nobody loves me like you do
What if I never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
Ooh, you touched my heart in places
That I never even knew
'Cause nobody loves me like you do
I was words without a tune
I was a song still unsung
A poem with no rhyme
A dancer out of time
But now there's you
Nobody loves me like you do
What if I never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
Ooh, you touched my heart in places
That I never even knew
Nobody loves me
(Nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me
(Nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me like you do
Nobody loves me like you do
There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mmm-hmm
Oh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love
Ooh, how will I know (don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know (love can be deceiving)
How will I know
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now, uh-huh
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love
Ooh, tell me how will I know (don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know (love can be deceiving)
How will I know
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?
If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
Ooh, if he loves me not
Hey, if he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh, how will I know, how will I know
How will I know
Hey, how will I know
Ooh, how will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?
How will I know (how will I know)
How will I know
How will I know (I say a prayer)
How will I know
Ooh, how will I know (I fall in love)
How will I love, hey, how will I know?
All at once
I finally took a moment
And I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it's finally hit me all at once
All at once I've started counting teardrops
And at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once
Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it's hurt me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once
All at once I looked around and found that you were
With another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered all at once
All at once the smile that used to greet me
Brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories all at once
Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it's hurt me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And it's hurt me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once
And that's all that matters now
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And it's hurt me more than you know
So much more
Time can pass so slowly when you feel so all alone
Love can strike like lightning when you find your heart a home
I've see it in the movies, read about it in a book
I never thought I'd feel it but your touch was all it took
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
Come and make your magic 'til you have me hypnotized
If we get any closer I'll be drowning in your eyes
You're the one I needed most when my love was on that line
I'm so glad you gave me yours when I gave you mine
So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good (oh it keeps me feelin' so)
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of me
Baby, you're the first to take it
And you're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good (oh it keeps me feelin' so)
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
I believe the children are our are future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest
Love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest
Love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all
And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love
I'll hold you and touch you
And make you my woman
And give you my love with sweet surrender
Tonight our hearts will beat as one
And I will hold you, touch you
And make you my woman tonight
There's something in your eyes I see
A pure and simple honesty
Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the mornin' sun appears
We'll find our way together
I believe you when you say that you love me
Know that I won't take you for granted
Tonight the magic has begun
So won't you hold me, touch me
And make me your woman tonight?
There's something in your eyes I see
I won't betray your trust in me
Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the mornin' sun appears
We'll find our way together
I'll hold you and touch you
Hold me, touch me baby
Make you my woman
Make me your woman
Tonight
Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
There's something in your eyes I see
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
Something in your eyes I see
When the mornin' sun appears
We'll find our way together
Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
There's something in your eyes I see
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
Something in your eyes I see
When the mornin' sun appears
We'll find our way together
Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out, but you came home around three
If six of y'all went out
Then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt
It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
I pack your bags so you can leave town for a week (yes I am)
The phone rings and then you look at me (Why'd you turn and look at me)
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street (boy)
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID
I've been through all this before
So how could you think
That I would stand around and take some more
Things are gonna change
'Cause I won't be your fool anymore
That's why you have to leave
So don't turn around to see my face
There's no more tears left here for you to see
Was it really worth you going out like that
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back
See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out, you were making a fool of me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
You said you'd be here by nine
Instead you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit trying not to cry
Asking myself why
You'd do this to me
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say:
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me
Now I see that you've been doing wrong
You played me all along
And made a fool of me, baby
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me
How could you do it to me
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say:
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me
Heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna take it no more
I ain't gonna take it no more
I ain't gonna take it no more
Everything that you said was a lie
Don't lie to me
Tell me what it is and I will be alright
If tomorrow is judgment day
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
If I wake up in World War III
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the street (on the street Lord)
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (okay)
It's okay if you're sleeping with me
As the years they pass us by (the years, the years, the years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you baby
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
If I should die this very day (very very very day)
Don't cry (don't cry), 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say (really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hope for a song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
Mmmyeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill (Mmm)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
(Hey)
(Ooh)
They don't always happen when you ask
And its easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says hope is very near, oh (Oh)
There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah) (Though hope is frail)
Though hope is frail (Its hard)
Its hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)
When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you believe (When you)
(Oh oh)
Now tell me how you feel if I told
You that I have feelings for you
And would it be so wrong to say
What's on my mind
I'm sorry I have to
We were friends but with time
What I feel inside for you has changed
But I'd give up on love, if I thought
That it was untrue for you
I wanted to see you
(And if I told you that) I beg to please you
(If I told you that) I'll always keep you
What would you say (if I told you that)
I know that we were just friends
But what if I decide to bring somethings in
I hope it won't offend the trust
We have cause I don't want this to end
I you think that we'll lose what we have
Then I'd just rather stay (rather stay) the same
(I'd rather stay the same)
Cause I don't want to choose
Between two of the most precious things to me
(tell me)
I wanted to see you
(And if I told you that) I beg to please you
(If I told you that) I'll always keep you
What would you say (if I told you that)
If we take this chance and extend
To each other romance
I hope it would be
The right thing for you and me
I wanted to see you
(And if I told you that) I beg to please you
(If I told you that) I'll always keep you
What would you say (if I told you that)
Would you be there for me
Could you dare to hold me
Will my feelings leave me
Lonely if I told you
Here is Whitney missy you'all
(Ninety nine oh)
Hey missy
You believe this girl
(Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh)
Misdemeanor
Missy, missy misdemeanor

I can't get no sleep
They just keep warnin' me
Should I believe it?
They say I don't need it
Don't they know I made up my mind
My mind
Why you all in my business?
Get a job
Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart
One more time, oh, no no
Did you think I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there
Did you think you could walk back
In my life, oh
So you found you missed the love you threw away
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late
And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you
I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye
Would a sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you are the last thing on my mind
Now you say you're sorry and you've
Changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late
And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you
So when all you've got are sleepless night
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you
Who said goodbye, who said goodbye
And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you
I learned from the best
I learned from you
I say yes boy (say yes)
Oh yeah (Oh yes)

The way I felt your chest up next to mine
Felt you in my heart
Now I breathe love
You are so amazing

You're the best love I ever knew
Can't nobody do me like you do
You're the down on my last dime
No one else worth none of my time
Everything 'bout you I love
You were sent from the sky's above
You came here to rescue me
Well, now I'm free
You're the best love I ever knew
Can't nobody do me like you do
You're the down on my last dime
No one else worth none of my time
Everything 'bout you I love
You were sent from the sky's above
You came here to rescue me
Well, now I'm free

Unbelievable baby
It's you that makes me smile
When everything is crazy
You're the one I love
No other man can faze me
Cause you're in my heart
I'm in your heart
Every minute daily
Remember when
It all began
We were all in love
Then came the friends
Telling you when
Your time for me was good enough
I constantly
Had to compete
With your crew and their schemes
Remembering
Back in the day
I used to mean everything
To the way it used to be
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back
Now tell me why
So many nights
You had so much to do
When you said bye
Sometimes I tried
I tried to make you choose
Now tell me how
You can allow
You boys to control
The time we shared
It was unfair
But now you need to know
That I'm moving on
(Boy what would you do)
Things just ain't the same
(We were supposed to)
Conquer everything yeah
(Boy let me tell you)
You've got to make a change
To the way it used to be
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back
To the way it used to be
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back
I lost my heart a long time ago
You made me feel like no one had before
Boy, you made me love you
Then you walked out the door
See, I will not rest until you say I'm forever yours
And boy I won't stop at nothing
I won't give you up
And you've gotta feel something
I know I will not love again
Until you come back
Come back to my arms
Till you come back to me baby
Until you come back
I don't care how long baby
It's not important to me
Don't care how far
Love's never too far for me, oh no it ain't
I just might be crazy, yes I am
When it comes to my heart
But I can not rest until
The day we're no longer apart
And boy I won't stop at nothing
I won't give you up
And you've gotta feel something
I know I will not love again
Until you come back
Come back to my arms
Till you come back to me baby
Until you come back
To me
Nobody plays with my heart
You can walk away from it all, baby
You can run but your heart can not hide
'Cause it knows you belong in my arms
And boy I won't stop at nothing
I won't give you up
And you've gotta feel something
I know I will not love again
Until you come back
Come back to my arms
Till you come back to me baby
Until you come back
To me
Oh yeah
Till you come back to me baby
Come on home, come home
To me
Tired of playing this game
And I won't play it no more
And I won't take it no more
Through with being your fool
And I won't do it no more
And I won't, I won't keep up this act
Not for one minute
I'm gonna pull, I'm gonna pull this curtain down
This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change
And I bow out
I won't be hanging around, baby
I decline to take the pain
And I resign the masquerade
And I bow out
I won't be staying around, baby
I bow out
Can't go on with the show
You're just a stage I went through
Now you're just fading from view, yeah baby
It's time for a change of scene
Guess I'll be taking my leave
I guess I won't, I won't stay in this play
Not for one minute
I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make my exit now
Oh baby
This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change
And I bow out
I won't be hanging around, baby
I decline to take the pain
And I resign the masquerade
And I bow out
I won't be staying around, baby
I bow out
When you're left standing on that stage all alone
Maybe you will realize
You should of learned to treat me right
And when this final act is finally through
Maybe you'll wish you'd been
The kind of man you should have been
Now watch me say goodbye
And walk right out of your life
Oh baby, all right babe
This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change
And I bow out
I won't be hanging around, baby
I decline to take the pain
And I resign the masquerade
And I bow out
I won't be staying around, baby
I bow out
This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change
And I bow out
I won't be hanging around, baby
I decline to take the pain
And I resign the masquerade
And I bow out
I won't be staying around, baby
I bow out
If there's a time
When the tears should fill your eyes
And you can't see past the shadows
To the sun on the other side
Don't despair
Because there always will be someone there
Don't lose faith
Love won't let you lose your way, because you
You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by
Oh yes it is, yes
If there's a day when the rain should find your heart
And you're cold and tired and lonely
And this world has you in the dark
Don't be scared
You can just reach for me
And I'll be there
Don't lose hope
Love will see you through you know
I'll be, 'cause you
You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by
Standing by to life you above
All the hurt and pain, oh yeah
Standing by to carry you through
All the tears and rain
Oh reach for me
(I'll be there for you)
Reach for me babe, yeah
(I'll see you through)
See I'll be the one to hold you
The one to show you that you
You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by
You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by
Oh, love is standing by
Hey, hey, hey
Sing it for me y'all!
See I was born in Newark (sure was)
Drive from Orchard Park now
We were always hand in hand
He wore high top shoes and shirt tails
Nip wore her pigtails
I knew I loved him even then
You know some disapproved it
They even boohooed it
But I told them time and time and time again
You know I was made to love him
Build my world around him
Hey, hey, hey
He's been my inspiration, showed appreciation
For the love I gave him through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My love grew sweeter through the years
I know my baby loves me (my baby loves me)
My baby needs me (needs me)
That's why we've made it through the years
I was made to love him
Worship and adore him, yes say
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
But I love my baby, love my baby, oh
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
I know I ain't going nowhere
I was just a little thing
The love bug hit me
I had the fever with each passing year
If all should tumble
And the whole world crumble
By his side I'll still be standing, yeah
Cause I was made to love him
Made meant for him, say
Hey, hey, hey
I was made to love him
Build my world all around him say
Hey, hey, hey
I love my baby
Nip ain't going nowhere
Say hey, hey, hey
(Ad lib until fade)
