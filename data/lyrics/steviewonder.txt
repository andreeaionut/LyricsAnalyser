Spoken by SW:
"When you say that you kill in the
name of God or in the name of Allah,
you are truly cursing God, for that is not of God.
When you say that you hate in the name of God or Allah,
you are lying to God, for that is not of our Father.
Let us pray that we see the light."

There are people who have let the problems of today
Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way
But every problem has an answer and if yours you cannot find
You should talk it over to Him
He'll give you peace of mind
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend
Never communicating with the One who lives within
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down
And you can talk to him anytime He's always around
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
Well He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world
For solving problems of all men, women, little boys and girls
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When your load's too much to bear
Just go talk to God He cares
I know he does
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
Thank you
Thank you very much
Would you like to go with me
Down my dead end street
Would you like to come with me
To village ghetto land
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals
From garbage cans
Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink
Drunk to all demands
Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the streets
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me would you be happy
Still in 1995 livin' in village ghetto land
Village ghetto land
Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
Just because a record has a groove
Don't make it hit the groove
But you can tell by the dance that let's you in
When the people start to move
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over, people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over, people
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over, people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over, people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over, people
Can't you feel it all over?
Everybody all over, people
Looking back on when I was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door, I thought I told you not to go outside
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her from whippin' your behind
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so
Brother says he's tellin' 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall, I can't do it
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin' it, it sure felt out of sight
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
What did you say?
Baby, baby, baby
I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's sumptin' bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's supmtin' bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's sumptin' bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's sumptin' bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling I don't...

Summer soft
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus
She brings gifts through her breeze
Morning rain
Gently plays her rythms on your window pane
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
To bring rain or sunshine
And so you wait to see what she'll do
Is it sun or rain for you
But it breaks your heart in two
When you find it's october
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
Taking with her summer's play
Winter wind
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer he begins
Forcing dangers 'way with his breeze
Morning snow
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when he never lets you know
If it's snow or clear days you'll find
And so you wait to see what he'll do
Is it sun or snow for you
But it breaks your heart in two
Cause you've been fooled by april
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone
You find it's october
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
You've been fooled by april
And she's gone
And she's gone
Winter's gone
You find it's october
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
You've been fooled by april
And she's gone
And she's gone
Winter's gone

When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart

When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart

Tell her you're glad
It's over in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back
Takin that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart
In your heart
In your heart

[PART II]

You're just a masochistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head
But like a playboy you said no
or*di*nary pain
This little girl's mind you will blow
or*di*nary pain
But then I blew you out the box
or*di*nary pain
When I put my stuff on key and lock
or*di*nary pain
It makes me feel kind of sick
or*di*nary pain
To know love put you in a trick
or*di*nary pain
I knew our love would have to end
or*di*nary pain
The day I made it with your friend
or*di*nary pain
Giving your love to one unreal
or*di*nary pain
Like a big fool I know you feel
or*di*nary pain
But in this lovie-dovie game
or*di*nary pain
With all its joy there must be pain
or*di*nary pain
But now the time has surely come
or*di*nary pain
This game don't seem like so much fun
or*di*nary pain
You're cryin' big crocodile tears
or*di*nary pain
Don't match the ones I've cried for years
or*di*nary pain
When I was home waiting for you
or*di*nary pain
You were out somewhere doing the do
or*di*nary pain
You know I'd really like to stay
or*di*nary pain
But like you did I've got to play
or*di*nary pain
You're dumb to think I'd let you be
or*di*nary pain
Scott free without some pain from me
or*di*nary pain
I heard your song and took a chance
or*di*nary pain
But to your music I can't dance
or*di*nary pain
Go tell your story 'sob-sad'
or*di*nary pain
About you blowin' what you had
or*di*nary pain
Since one ain't good enough for you
or*di*nary pain
Then do yourself see how you do
or*di*nary pain

or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love
We'd be making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love?
Isn't she pretty?
Truly the Angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy,
We have been Heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love?
Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely, made from love
I've always come to the conclusion that 'but' is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on ones head
So I have tried to not be the one who 'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside I think you should know
And baby that's you, you, you
Made life's history
Caue you've brought some Joy Inside My Tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some Joy Inside My Tears
I've alwys felt that tomorroqw is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming fr and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring
Baby, baby it's you, you, you
Made life's history
Oh baby, you've brought some Joy Inside My Tears
Baby you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some Joy Inside My Tears
You brought some Joy Inside My Tears
You brought some Joy Inside My
Tears
You've brought some Joy Inside My Tears
Baby, baby you have done what no one thought could be
Hey, you brought some Joy Inside My Tears
Gotta tell you
You, you, you made life's history
You brought some Joy Inside My Tears
You brought you brought you brought some Joy Inside My Tears
Baby baby baby you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some Joy Inside My Tears
You made it baby you made it baby made it made life's his*to*ry
You you you made life's history
You brought some Joy Inside My Tears
You have done what no one thought could be
No-body ever thought it would be
You have done what no one thought could be
You you you made life's history
Gotta shout about it baby
You brought some Joy Inside My Tears
You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some Joy Inside My Tears
You you you made life's history
You brought some Joy Inside My Tears
You brought some Joy Inside My Tears
You brought some joy inside my
Tears

There's songs to make you smile
There's songs to make you sad
But with an happy song to sing
It never seems so bad
To me came this melody
So I've tried to put in words how I feel
Tomorrow will be for you and me
I am singing of topmorrow
I am singing of love
I am singing someday love will reign
Througout this world of ours
I am singing of love from my heart
Let's all sing someday sweet love will reign
Througout this world of ours
Let's start singing
Of love from our hearts
Let's start singing
Of love from our hearts
If it's magic...
Then why can't it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poets in this rhyme
Like the galaxies in time
If it's pleasing...
Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
So...
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
So...
If it's magic...
Why can't we make it everlasting
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

[Verse 2]
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
Cause I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
(Did you know that you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

[Bridge]
We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream-Um (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you

But all my heart can hear is your melody
So long ago my heart without demanding

Packing my bags-going away
To a place where the air is clean
On saturn
There's no sense to sit and watch the people die
We don't fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes
There's no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just can't be bought or sold
Tell me why are you people so cold
I'm...
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars cause we've learn to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high
We have come here many times before
To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men, women and children
That don't even know what they are dying for
We can't trust you when you take a stand
With a cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy
I'm...
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars cause we've learn to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high
She's a miss beautiful supreme
A girl that others wish that they could be
If there's seven wonders of the world
Then I know she's gotta be number one
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
She's the sunflower of nature's seeds
A girls that some men only find in their dreams
When she smiles it seems the stars all know
Cause one by one they start to light up the sky

Born and raised on ghetto streets

With a rhythm that is made of love
And the happiness that she only brings

Born and raised on ghetto streets

She's a girl in a dream
She sees a four eyed cartoon monster on the t.v. screen
She takes another puff and says "it's a crazy scene"
That red is green
And she's a tangerine
I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't left the ground
I'm too high
I'm too high
I hope I never ever come down
She's the girl in her life
But her world's a superficial paradise
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But no dice
She wasn't very nice
Ooh
Dodo do do do dodo
Do do dodo do dodo
Do do do do do do
Dodo do do do dodo

I'm too high

I can't ever touch the sky
I'm too high
I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to die
She's a girl of the past
I guess that I got to her at last
A did you hear the news about the girl today
She passed away
What did her friend say
They said she's too high
Too high
Can't hang around anyway...
Dodo do do do dodo
Do do dodo do dodo

People hand in hand
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land?
Where hate's a dream and love forever stands
Or is this a vision in my mind?
The law was never passed
But somehow all men feel they're truly free at last
Have we really gone this far through space and time
Or is this a vision in my mind?
I'm not one who makes believe
I know that leaves are green
They only change to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending
But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away
To the vision in our mind?
I'm not one who makes believes
I know that leaves are green
They only change to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending
But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to take our wings and fly away
To the vision in our minds?
A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong movin' in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city
His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city
His sister's black but she is sure not pretty
Her skirt is short but, Lord, her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city
Her brother's smart, he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
'Cause where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city
Living just enough for the city
Living just enough for the city
Living just enough for the city
His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walkin' the streets of New York city
He's almost dead from breathin' in air pollution
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution
Living just enough, just enough for the city
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is crelu no where could be much colder
If we don't change the world will soon be over
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city
Looking in your eyes
Kind of heaven eyes
Closing both my eyes
Waiting for surprise
To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far
Cause I'm not afraid to try and go it
To know the love and the beauty never known before
I'll leave it up to you to show it
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away
Looking at your hands
Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance
Just to hold your hand
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that you're a dream come true
There's no way that I'll be losing
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that you're my dream come true
There is no way that I'll be losing
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there

All is fair in love
Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say
But all is changed with time
The future no one can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery
But all is fair in love
I had to go away
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The loosing side I'll play
But all is fair in love
I should never have left your side
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reachin' out in vain
Accepting the things not worth having but
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
But just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces but
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out... Yeah
When you get it off... your trip
Don't you worry 'bout a thing... Yeah
Don't you worry 'bout a thing... Yeah
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out...
When you get it off... your trip
Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama
Cause I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out

His only concern is how much you'll pay
He's Misstra Know-It-All

[Verse 6]

Oh, He's Misstra Know-It-All
