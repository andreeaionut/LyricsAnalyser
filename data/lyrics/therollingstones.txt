Oh yeah
I hear you talking
When I'm on the street
Your mouth don't move
But I can hear you speak
What's the matter with the boy?
He don't come around no more
Is he checking out for sure?
Is he gonna close the door on me?
I'm always hearing voices
On the street
I want to shout
But I can't hardly speak
I was making love last night
To a dancer friend of mine
I can't seem to stay in step
Come every time that she pirouettes over me
And I only get my rocks off
While I'm dreaming
I only get my rocks off
While I'm sleeping
I'm zipping through the days
At lightning speed
Plug in, flush out
And fire the fuckin' feed
Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more
But I only get my rocks off
While I'm dreaming
I only get my rocks off
While I'm sleeping
Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene
It's all mesmerized, all that inside me
The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows, moonlight mystery
Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more
And I only get my rocks off
While I'm dreaming
I only get my rocks off
While I'm sleeping
And I only get my rocks off
While I'm dreaming
And I only get my rocks off
While I'm sleeping
Only get them off
Only get them off
Get them off
Only get them off, get them off
Only get them off
Mama says yes, Papa says no
Make up your mind 'cause I gotta go
We're gonna raise hell at the Union Hall
Drive myself right over the wall
Rip this joint, gonna save your soul
Round and round and round we go

Start my starter, gonna stop the show (Yeah)
Whoa, yeah!

Skydiver inside her, sLip rope, stunt flyer
Wounded lover, got no time on hand
One last cycle, thrill freak Uncle Sam
Pause for bus'ness, hope you'll understand
Judge and jury walk out hand in hand
Dietrich movies, close up boogies
Kissing cunt in Cannes
Grotesque music, million dollar sad
Got no tactics, got no time on hand
Left shoe shuffle, right shoe muffle
Sinking in the sand
Fade out freedom, steaming heat on
Watch that hat in black
Finger twitching, got no time on hand
Mmm yeah! (Woo, woo)
Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me

Don't matter where you are
Everybody's gonna need a ventilator
When you're trapped and circled with no second chances
Code of living is your gun in hand
Can't be browed by beating, can't be cowed by words
Messed by cheating, ain't gonna ever learn
Everybody walking 'round
Everybody trying to step on their Creator
Don't matter where you are, everybody, everybody gonna

Stand up and be counted, can't get a witness
Sometimes you need somebody, if you have somebody to love
Sometimes you ain't got nobody and you want somebody to love

Warm like the evening sun

But I just can't seen to drink you off my mind
It's those honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme those honky tonk blues

And feeds them to his geese
Don'cha think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?
Come on now, honey
We can build a home for three
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?
And there's a score of harebrained children
They're all locked in the nursery
They got earphone heads they got dirty necks
They're so 20th century
Well they queue up for the bathroom
'Round about 7:35
Don'cha think we need a woman's touch to make it come alive?
You'd look good pram pushing down the high street
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?
Whoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear
The cook she is a whore
Yes, the butler has a place for her
Behind the pantry door
The maid, she's French, she's got no sense
She's wild for Crazy Horse
And when she strips, the chauffeur flips
The footman's eyes get crossed
Don'cha think there's a place for us
Right across the street
Don'cha think there's a place for you,
In between the sheets?
Well, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, you can lean on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, you can lean on me
She said, my breasts, they will always be open
Baby, you can rest your weary head right on me
And there will always be a space in my parking lot
When you need a little coke and sympathy
Yeah we all need someone we can dream on
And if you want it baby, you can dream on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can cream on
Yeah and if you want to, you can cream on me
I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement
When you drunk my health in scented jasmine tea
But you knifed me in my dirty filthy basement
With that jaded, faded, junky nurse oh what pleasant company, ha
Though, we all need someone we can feel on
Yeah and if you want it, you can feel on me, hey

I'm a-talkin' 'bout the midnight rambler
Everybody got to go
Well I'm a-talkin' 'bout the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
I'm sighin' down the wind so sadly
A-listen and you'll hear me moan
Well I'm a talkin' 'bout the midnight gambler
And everybody got to go
(Yeah c'mon)
Talkin' 'bout the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
I'm talkin' 'bout the midnight rambler
Did you see me jump the garden wall
I don't give you a hoot of warning
A-dressed up in my black cat cloak
I don't see the light of the morning
I'll split the time the cock'rel crows
I'm tellin' 'bout the midnight rambler
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm a-talkin' 'bout the midnight gambler
And everybody got to go
Oh, don't do that
Well, you heard about the Boston
Honey, it's not one of those
Talkin' 'bout the midnight, shit!
Did you see me jump bedroom door
I'm called the hit and run raper, in anger
Or just a knife sharpened, tippy toe
Or just a shoot 'em dead, brainbell jongleur
Everybody got to go
If you ever meet the midnight rambler
And he's prowlin' down your marble hall
And he's pouncin' like a proud black panther
You should say, I told you so
If you listen for the midnight rambler
Play it easy, easy, as you go
I'll go smash down all your plate glass windows
Put my fist through your stairway doors
Well I'm a-talkin' bout the midnight rambler
The one you never seen before
Well I'm a-talkin' bout the midnight rambler
And did you see me jump your garden wall
And if you ever catch the Midnight Rambler
Steal your mistress from under your nose
Go easy with your cold fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat baby, and it hurts
Hey babe, what's in your eyes?
I saw them flashing like airplane lights
You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure
I must come back
For a little more
You got my heart, you got my soul
You got the silver you got the gold
You got the diamonds, from the mine
Well that's all right
It'll buy some time
Tell me, honey, what will I do
When I'm hungry and thirsty too
Feeling foolish and that's for sure
Just waiting here
At your kitchen door?
Hey baby, what's in your eyes?
Is that the diamonds from the mine?
What's that laughing in your smile?
I don't care,
No, I don't care
Oh babe, you got my soul
You got the silver you got the gold
If that's your love, it just made me blind
I don't care
No, that's no big surprise
I'm a fleabit peanut monkey
And all my friends are junkies
That's not really true
I'm a cold Italian pizza
I could use a lemon squeezer
What you do?
But I've been bit and I've been tossed around
By every she-rat in this town
Have you babe?
But I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey woman too
I was bitten by a boar
I was gouged and I was gored
But I pulled on through
Yeah, I'm a sack of broken eggs
I always have an unmade bed
Don't you?
Well I hope we're not too messianic
Or a trifle too satanic
But we love to play the blues
But well I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey woman too
Monkey woman too babe
I'm a monkey man
I'm a monkey man
I'm a monkey man
I'm a monkey man
I'm a monkey
I'm a monkey
I'm a monkey
I'm a monkey
Monkey, monkey
Monkey
Monkey
I'm a monkey
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was her footloose man
No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime you find
You get what you need
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was her footloose man
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, well, you might find
You get what you need
And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't we're gonna blow a fifty-amp fuse"
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find
You get what you need
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
I said to him
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You get what you need
You get what you need, yeah, oh baby
I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well, I could tell by her blood-stained hands
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You just might find
You get what you need
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You just might find
You get what you need, oh yeah
