Oh, now you can have me
When you want me
You simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one
Who makes me come running
'Cause what you got
Is far beyond compare
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya
One hit of your love affected me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Oh, I can't be elusive with you honey
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
You're the only thing I want to do
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
Harlem world we won't stop for Mariah, you're on fire
Harlem world we won't stop, so Mariah, take us higher
Harlem world we won't stop, for Mariah, you're on fire
Harlem world we won't stop, so Mariah, take us higher
Break it down
Every little thing you do
Now, what we gonna do right here
Is we gonna smooth it out
(Honey got me hooked on you)
MC, and she won't stop
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly, butterfly
I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
So flutter through the sky
Butterfly
Fly
Spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
(I'd) give my all for your love
Tonight
Oh yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, yeah
It wasn't raining yet
But it was definitely
A little misty on
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
And so we finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words I love you
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
Pretty baby, how I'm missing you
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Trembling
Starry eyed
As you put your hand in mine
It was twilight
On the Fourth of July
Sparkling colors were
Strewn across the sky
And we sat close enough
That we just barely touched
While roman candles
Went soaring above us and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we wandered away
I was trembling inside
But I wanted to stay
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind
On that Fourth of July
So starry eyed (so starry eyed)
On the flowery hillside
Breathless and fervid
Amid the dandelions
As it swept over me
Like the wind trough the trees
I felt you sigh with a
Sweet intensity and baby
Then you put your hand in mine (your hand in mine)
And we floated away
Delicately lay entwined
In an intimate daze
A crescent moon began to shine (began to shine)
And I wanted to stay (stay)
Tangled up with you among the fireflies
On that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)
Thunder clouds (thunder clouds)
Hung around (hung around)
So threateningly (so threateningly)
Ominously hovering
And the sky (the sky)
Opened wide (opened wide)
Showering (oh yeah yeah9
Then you put your hand in mine (put your hand in mine)
And we ran from the rain (in the pouring rain, baby)
Tentatively kissed goodnight (tentatively kissed goodnight)
And went our separate ways (ways)
And I've never truly felt the way that I
Felt the Fourth of July (Fourth of July, Fourth of July)
Truly I have never felt the same inside
Like that Fourth of July (Fourth of July, Fourth of July)
Truly I could never feel the same as I
Felt that Fourth of July (Fourth of July), oh baby
Break break down,
Steady breakin' me on down, break break down,
Steady breakin' me on down,
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down,
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down.
You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me,
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was OK
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me
Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry
So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing "I will survive"
Do you lash out and say, how dare you leave this way?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away
Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry
It'll break you down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it, forget it (Forget it)
I be feelin' like you bringing me down
Taking me around
Stressin' me out
I think I better go and get out
And let me release some stress (Stress)
Don't ever wanna feel no pain (Pain)
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain (Rain, rain, rain)
Lord, I just wanna maintain
Yeah, I can feel pressures y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here (Here)
Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry
Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside

'Cause I don't want to reveal

And then I break down and cry
Yea
Oh Baby
Hmm hmm
It's two eleven and I'm stressin'
Watching TV in my hotel suite
I check my service every second
At two ten you still hadn't called me
(No no no no no)
So I'm gonna leave my cell phone
Turned on in my purse by the bed
And before I fall asleep
I guess I'll just check my machine
(Check it one one time)
Again and again because I'm
Obsessin' on you
I wanna be your baby doll
(I just wanna be your)
Wrap me up nice and tight
(Wrap me up nice and tight)
Love me all through the night
Come on lay me down

Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my baby doll
Zonin' out thinkin' about
You and me between the sheets
(Ohh ohh)
I want to get intimate
But you're not within my reach
(No no no no)
So I'll have a little more wine
And I'll try to drink you
Out of my head
(Try try try try try try try try)
And I'll lay awake awhile
'Til I'm high enough
I can forget all about you
(All about)
Until I wake up again
I wanna be your baby doll
(Baby, baby, baby)
Wrap me up nice and tight
(Wrap me up nice and tight)
Love me all through the night
(Ohh)
Come lay me down
(Ohh)
Enfold me in your arms

Cover me with velvet kisses
(Hmm oh my yea)
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my baby doll
(Be my baby doll)
Slipping into dreams
(Slipping into dreams)
I feel my love surround you
My subconscious seems
(My subconscious seems)
To weave itself around you
Do you care for me?
(Do you care for me?)
Beyond idolization
Tell me how you feel
But don't keep me at bay
'Cause I won't be waitin' long
(Aah)
I wanna be your babydoll
(I wanna be, wanna be your)
(I want to)
Wrap me up nice and tight
(Suicide baby)
Love me all through the night
(All through the night)
Come lay me down
(Come lay)
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
(Cover me)
Rock me on and on
(Rock me on and on)
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my baby doll
(And be my)
On and on and on and on and on
(Baby doll)
(I just wanna be the one, your wanna
Rock it till the morning lie)
I wanna be your baby doll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come on lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
(Ohh)
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me

I was wayward child
With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
Funny how one can learn
To grow numb to the madness
And block it away
I left the worst unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
Nearing the edge
Oblivious I almost
Fell right over
A part of me
Will never be quite able
To feel stable
That woman-child falling inside
Was on the verge of fading
Thankfully I
Woke up in time
Guardian angel I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image
And you're still alive
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raise my head to the sky
And though time rolls by
Still feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
Love wandered inside
Stronger than you
Stronger than I
And now that it has begun
We cannot turn back
We can only turn into one
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
And I'm truly inspired
Finding my soul (finding my soul)
There in your eyes (there in your eyes)
And you
Have opened my heart (have opened my heart)
And lifted me inside
By showing me yourself
Undisguised
And I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
Oh
And I will breathe for you each day
Comfort you through all the pain
Gently kiss your fears away
You can turn to me and cry
Always understand that I
Give you all I am inside
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
And be the one to catch you fall
Whenever you call, oh yes
Oh, whenever you call, whenever you call
Don't be afraid to fly
Spread your wings
Open up a door
So much more inside
Don't (don't)
Be afraid to fly (be afraid to fly)
Come spread your wings and just fly with me, and you'll see why
It's alright to
Fly
Fly
Just fly
Just fly
Don't be afraid
Don't let your spirit die
Just
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Don't be afraid to fly
Don't be afraid to just fly
Don't be afraid to just fly
Butterfly
Baby, fly, fly, fly, baby, fly
Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
Butterfly, butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly away (butterfly, butterfly)
Fly away (butterfly, butterfly)
Fly away (butterfly, butterfly)
Fly away (butterfly)
Fly away (butterfly, butterfly)
Fly away (butterfly, butterfly)
Fly away (butterfly, butterfly)
Butterfly
Baby baby baby
What's it gonna be?
Oh, baby, baby, baby, yeah yeah
Is it him or is it me?
Oh, don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind baby, yeah
Baby, baby, baby
Can't you stay with me tonight?
Oh baby, baby, baby
Come, on, don't my kisses please you right?
You were so hard to find
The beautiful ones they hurt you
Every time
Paint a perfect picture
And bring to life a vision in one's mind
The beautiful ones
(The beautiful ones)
Always smash the picture
Always every time
If I told you baby
That I was in love with you
Oh baby, baby, baby
If we got married (got married)
Would that be cool?
You make me so confused
The beautiful ones
You always seem to lose, baby
Baby, baby (yes baby, yes, baby)
See the beautiful ones
(The beautiful ones)
See the beautiful ones
(The beautiful ones)
Do you all hear
Do you all mean
'Cause I want you
Yes I mean, I want you
Oh yeah, baby
I want you, oh yeah
I want you
Alright
You may not know where I'm going baby
I may not know, said I may not know
Said you may not know
But I mean what I mean
But one thing, one thing is certain baby
I know what I want
And that's to please you baby, to please you baby
The one thing is I want you I want you
I need you oh so bad, so bad
I want you
Why oh why
Why oh why
Why oh why
Baby, why, oh baby baby baby
The beautiful ones
You wanna love me, love me
Or you wanna throw me away
I gotta know
I gotta know, baby
Gotta know, baby, baby, baby
Baby baby baby
I need you
Baby baby baby
I want you
Tell me why
The beautiful ones
They hurt you every time
It's hard to explain
Inherently it's just always been strange
Neither here nor there
Always somewhat out of place everywhere
Ambiguous
Without a sense of belonging to touch
Somewhere halfway
Feeling there's no one completely the same
Standing alone
Eager to just
Believe it's good enough to be what
You really are
But in your heart
Uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the
Outside
Early on, you face
The realization you don't
Have a space
Where you fit in
And recognize you
Were born to exist
Standing alone
Eager to just
Believe it's good enough to be what
You really are
But in your heart
Uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the
Outside
And it's hard
And it's hard
And it's hard
Irreversibly
Falling in between
And it's hard
And it's hard
To be understood
As you are
As you are
Oh, and God knows
That you're standing on your own
Blind and unguided
Into a world divided
You're thrown
Where you're never quite the same
Although you try, try and try
To tell yourself
You really are
But in your heart uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the outside
You'll always be
Somewhere on the outside
Oh
Keepin' it real, son, that's right
The shining star, you're my shining star, girl
Yo, New York in the house
Is Brooklyn in the house?
Uptown in the house
Shaolin, are you in the house?
Boogie Down, are you in the house?
Sacramento in the house
Atlanta, Georgia, are you in the house?
West Coast, are you in the house?
Japan, are you in the house?
Everybody, are you in the house?
Baby, baby come on
Baby come on, baby come on
Oh, when you walk by every night
Talkin' sweet and lookin' fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darlin', if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
Fantasy (Remix)
Sweet fantasy (sweet sweet)
In my fantasy
Sweet fantasy
Sweet, sweet fantasy
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're goin' to my head (I like that)
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
, I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
My fantasy
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find
And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
So shy a bundle of butterflies
Flush with heat of desire
On a natural high
As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart in you
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
Beautiful and bitter sweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good bye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was
Drifting drifting drifting drifting
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars, baby, baby, yeah
Sorry I never told you all I wanted to say...
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away so faraway ay-ay-ay-ay
Never had I imagined your living without your smile...
Feeling knowing you hear me it keeps me alive alive...
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
Together
One sweet day...
Loving you always and I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven
Darlin' I never showed you
(I never showed you)
Assumed you'd always be there (always be there)
I thought you'd always be there
And I... I... I take
(taken for granted) your presence for granted
But I always cared
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
(lost along the way)
And I know eventually
(I know I know) we'll be together
We'll be together
One sweet day...
And all that I know is I'll wait
(w-h-o-a...) patiently to see you in heaven
Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day...
Y-e-a-h... yeah Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray...
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many (like so many) friends we've lost along the way
And I know (yes I know) eventually (I know) we'll be together
Together
(Y-e-a-h...) One sweet day
(one sweet day one sweet day)
Oh, yeah...
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
I'll see you eventually
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
I know you're lookin' down from heaven
And I know... I... know eventually we'll be together
(ooh-ooh) Yes we will
One sweet day...
One sweet d-a-y...
Patiently to see you in heaven
Sorry I never told you (ooh-ooh)
All I wanted to say...
Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind
We sailed on together
We've drifted apart
And here you are by my side
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms
Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay
So now I come to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms
We were as one babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you wanna be free
So I'm letting you fly
'Cause I know in my heart babe
Our love will never die, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
I ain't gonna cry no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
You'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart babe
Our love will never end, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
I know that you'll be back boy
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
I know that you'll be right back baby
Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time, time
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
You and I will always be
No way you're never gonna shake me
No way you're never gonna shake me
You and I will always be
Once I was a prisoner
Lost inside myself
With the world surrounding me
Wandering through the misery
But now I am free
You gave me a breath of life
Unclouded my eyes
With sweet serenity
Lighting a ray of hope for me
And now I am free
Free to live
Free to laugh
Free to soar
Free to shine
Free to give
Free to love
Free enough to fly
Once I was all so alone
Unsteady and cold
But your love rained down upon me
Washing away uncertainty
But now
I am
Now, oh, now
Now
I am free, I am free
Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me
Transcending space and time
And I was a rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no one else
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep, oh oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be a same
Only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changin' you with a tide
And dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Wakening you inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there, all at once, I knew
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep, oh oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same
With no beginning
And without an end
You are the one for me
And it's evident
And your eyes told me so, oh oh yeah
Your eyes let me know, oh oh oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe,
I fell so deep, oh oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be a same
Oh no
Never be the same
Oh
Yeah
No
Yeah yeah yeah
Once upon a time
You whispered softly in my ear
Loving words and fairytales
That I longed to hear
I gave you my body and soul
And you took control
As you slowly swept me up
And carried me away
You told me pretty lies
As I held onto you tight
You knew how to get your way
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace
Long ago
You used to want me
(Now it's all so far away)
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday
Every now and then
I drown in thoughts of yesterday
And the fools' paradise that you blew away
I feel you beside me again
And remember when you came to my window
On a dark and stormy day
Baby, I need you now
Tonight I'm crumbling down (down)
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me
Long ago
You used to want me
(Now it's all so far away)
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me (used haunt, used haunt me)
Long ago
You used to want me
(Now it's all so far away)
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday
Oh baby, I need you now
'Cause tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me
Long ago
You used to want me
(Now it's all so far away)
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me, haunt me
And take me back to yesterday
Long ago
You used to want me
(Now it's all so far away)
But you still haunt me
Long ago
You used to want me
(Now it's all so far away)
But you still haunt me
You come to me with a casual flow
And suddenly my defenses start to go
When you talk to me in that sensual tone
It envelopes me and I lose my self control
And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
Imagining that you're taking it slow
And so tenderly
'Til the feeling overflows
When you look at me I go soft and cave in
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening
And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine
And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
Those days of love are gone
Our time is through
Still I burn on and on
All of my life
Only for you
From now
Until forever
And ever my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one
As long as I shall live
I'll hold you dear
And I will reminisce
Of our love all through the years
From now
Until forever
And ever my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one
If you should ever need me
Unfailingly, I will return to your arms
And unburden your heart
And if you should remember
That we belong together
Never be ashamed
Call my name
Tell me I'm the one you treasure
Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one
Forever
You will always be the only one
Forever
You will always be the only one
Forever
You will always be the only one
Forever
You will always be the only one
Forever
You will always be the only one
La da da
So sweet
In my daydream
Every night you creep into my dreams
Fantasy
It's so real but it's a fantasy
Every night you creep into my dreams
It's so real
In my daydream
It's just as sweet
It is so sweet
And oh
In my daydream
It seems so real
Touch me
Come into my dreams
Come to me
But it's just a fantasy
It feels so sweet
But it's just not real
Oh baby
It's just a sweet
Fantasy
Daydream is all that I can do
I feel pleasure over you
In silence
I keep it to myself
Come take me
Don't want nobody else
La da da di da
And it's sweet
So sweet
And it's sweet
So sweet
And it's sweet
So sweet
And it's deeper than like a reality(so sweet, o sweet)
Building in the sky
But it's just a fantasy
Oh baby
Come into my dreams
It's just a fantasy
You look at me and see the girl
Who lives inside the golden world
But don't believe
That's all there is to see
You'll never know the real me
She smiles through a thousand tears
And harbors adolescent fears
She dreams of all
That she can never be
She wades in insecurity
And hides herself inside of me
Don't say she takes it all for granted
I'm well aware of all I have
Don't think that I am disenchanted
Please understand
It seems as though I've always been
Somebody outside looking in
Well here I am for all of them to bleed
But they can't take my heart from me
And they can't bring me to my knees
They'll never know the real me
