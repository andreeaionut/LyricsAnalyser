Well, it's one for the money,
Two for the show,

You can do anything but lay off of my Blue suede shoes.

Step in my face,
Slander my name
All over the place.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my Blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

You can burn my house,
Steal my car,
Drink my liquor
From an old fruitjar.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

Just because you think you're so pretty,
And just because your momma thinks you're hot,
Well, just because you think you've got something
That no other girl has got,
You've caused me to spend all my money.
You laughed and called me old santa claus.
Well, I'm telling you,
Baby, I'm through with you.
Because, well well, just because.
Well, well, well,
There'll come a time when you'll be lonesome
And there'll come a time when you'll be blue.

And now, now you say we are through.

A long long time ago.
Well, just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your mama thinks you're the hottest thing in

You've caused me to spend all of my money.
Honey, you laughed and called me your old santa claus.
Well, I'm telling you I'm through with you

Got a gal named Sue
She knows just what to do
She rocks to the east
She rocks to the west
She's the gal I love best

I got a gal named Daisy
She almost drives me crazy
She knows how to love me
Yes indeed, boy you don't know
What she does to me

I've been traveling over mountains
Even through the valleys, too
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you.

Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way
baby, trying to get to you

When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us,
But they didn't mean a thing.

I just had to reach you, baby,
In spite of all that I've been through.
I kept traveling night and day,
I kept running all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do,
I would travel night and day,
And I'd still run all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true

Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through,
When my way was dark as night,
He would shine His brightest light,
When I was trying to get to you.
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
And if you say good-bye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna love you more and more in every way
And if you say good-bye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna tell my mama tell my papa too
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
And if you say good-bye
Say if you ever even try
I'll never let you go, little darlin'.
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry.
I'll never let you go, 'cause I love you.
So please don't ever say good-bye.
The stars would tumble down beside me,
The moon would hang its head and cry.
My arms would never hold another baby doll
If we should ever say good-bye.
Well, I'll never let you go,
Because I love you, pretty baby.
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry.
I made you cry.
Yeah, I'll never let you go,
'Cause I love you, little baby.
So please don't ever say good-bye.
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a pray for
Someone I really could care for
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
Without a love of my own
You know, the landlord rang my front door bell.
I let it ring for a long, long spell.
I went to the window,
I peeped through the blind,
And asked him to tell me what's on his mind.
He said,
Money, honey.
Money, honey.
Money, honey, if you want to get along with me.
Well, I screamed and I hollered,
I was so hard-pressed.
I called the woman that I loved the best.
I finally got my baby about half past three,
She said I'd like to know what you want with me.
I said,
Money, honey.
Money, honey.
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.
Well, I said tell me baby, what's wrong with you?
From this day on our romance is through
I said, tell me baby, face to face
How could another man take my place?
She said,
Money, honey.
Money, honey.
Money, honey,
If you want to get a long with me.
Well, I've learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the winds may blow.
The women may come and the women may go,
But before I say I love you so,
I want
Money, honey.
Money, honey.
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.
[Verse 1]
I had to leave town for a little while
You said, you'd be good while I'm gone
But the look in your eye done told me you told a lie
I know there's been some carrying on

[Chorus]
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look

[Verse 2]
The ash trays are all full of ashes
The floor needs a touch of the mop
There's a man downstairs with-a long bushy hair
He said your party was a three day romp

[Chorus]
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look

[Verse 3]
Baby, if you ever loved me
Then Bonnie and Clyde loved the law
And a bird can't fly and I don't like apple pie
And trees won't grow in Arkansas

[Chorus]
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look

[Verse 4]
I had to leave town for a little while
You said, you'd be good while I'm gone
But the look in your eye done told me you told a lie
Well, I know there's been some carrying on

[Chorus][x2]
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearing that loved on look
Shoop, shoop
I remember my first love affair
Somehow or another the whole darn thing went wrong
My mama had some great advice
So I thought I'd put it into words of this song
I can still hear her sayin' it

"Boy, oh, I see you're sitting' out there all alone
Cryin' your eyes out
Cause the woman that you love has gone
Oh, there's gonna be, there's gonna be
A whole lot of trouble in your life
Oh, so listen to me, get up off of your knees
Cause only the strong survive"

That's what she said:
"Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Oh, you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Don't go all around with your head hung down"

Well, I wouldn't let that little girl
No, I wouldn't let her know
That she made me feel like a clown
"There's a whole lot a girl
Lookin' for a good man like you
Oh, but you'll never meet them if you give up now
And say, your life is through"

And she said it
"Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Oh, you've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive"

[Bridge]
"Well, you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive"

[Outro]
"Well, you've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive"
Miscellaneous
I'll Hold You in My Heart (Till I Can Hold You in
I said I'd hold, I said I'd hold,
I said I'd hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Like you've never been held before
Well I'll think of you each day and then I'll dream the night away
Oh, 'till you are in my arms once more
The stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
I feel so blue 'cause I'm away from you
Yeah I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Oh darling please wait for me
You know the stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
I feel so blue 'cause I'm away, I'm away from you
Yeah I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Oh darling please wait for me
The stars up in the sky you know they know the reason why...
I feel so blue 'cause I'm away, I'm away, I'm away, I'm away from you
I said, I said I'd hold you in my heart, heart, heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Oh darling please wait for me
The stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
I, I feel so blue 'cause I'm away, I'm away from you
Yeah, I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Oh darling please wait for me
There's a long line of mourners driving down our little street
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see, oh, yeah
They're all of your rich friends who knew you in the city
And now they've finally brought, brought you home to me

When you left you know you told me that some day you'd be returnin'
In a fancy car all the town to see, oh, yeah
Well, now everyone is watching you, you finally had your dream
Yeah, and you're ridin' in a long black limousine

You know the papers told of how you lost your life, oh, yeah
The party, the party and the fatal crash that night
Well, the race upon the highway, oh, the curve you didn't see
When you're riding in that long black limousine

You're riding in that long black limousine

Through tear filled eyes I watch as you ride by, oh, yeah
A chauffeur, a chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
Well, I never, I never, never, never, oh, my heart, all my dreams
Yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine

Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
And the pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone
It keeps right on a-hurtin' every minute of the day
Every hour you're away, I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone
It keeps right on a-hurtin' every minute of the day
Every hour you're away, I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
Yes, it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone
[Verse 1]
That big eight-wheeler runnin' down the track
Mean your true lovin' Daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause he's Moving on, he's rolling on
You were flying' too high for my little old sky
So I'm moving' on

[Verse 2]
But some day, baby, when you've had your play
Your gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep moving on, keep rolling on
You were flying too high for my little old sky
So I'm moving on, move on, baby

[Verse 3]
Mr. Fireman, won't you please listen to me?
'Cause I gotta pretty momma in Tennessee
To keep rolling on, keep moving on
Please listen to me, let this rattler free
Keep moving on, move on, son, move on

[Verse 4]
Well, I told you, baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
And now I'm moving on, I'm rolling on
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
But I'm moving on, move on, baby, move on

[Bridge]
I said, "Move on", I said, "Move on"

[Verse 5][x2]
I said, "Move on", I said, "Move on"
I said, "Move on", I said, "Move on"
Well, I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
I said, "Move on"

[Verse 6]
Hey, hey, hey, move on, I said, "Move on"
Hey, hey, I said, "Move on", I said, "Move on"
I'm through with you but too bad you're blue
I said, "Move on, move on, move on"

[Outro]
I said, "Move on", I said, "Move on"
I said, "Move on", I said, "Move on"
Oh break it, burn it, drag it all around
Twist it, turn it, you can't tear it down
Cos' every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
By the strength and mighty power of my love
Crush it, kick it, you can never win
I know baby you can't lick it
I'll make you give in
Every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
By the strength and mighty power of my love
Baby I want you, you'll never get away
My love will haunt you yes haunt you night and day
Touch it, pound it, what good does it do
There's just no stoppin' the way I feel for you
Cos' every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
By the strength and mighty power of my love
Yeh, yeh, baby I want you, you'll never get away
My love will haunt you yes haunt you night and day
Touch it, pound it, what good does it do
There's just no stoppin' the way I feel for you
Cos' every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
By the strength and mighty power of my love
I said every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
By the strength and mighty power of my love
Every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
By the strength and mighty power of my love
It's knowin' that your door is always open
And you path is free to walk
That makes me tend to keep my sleeping bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

It's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the heat stains that have dried up on some lovin'
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
It keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns mellowed by me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we'd fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursin'
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours
You're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Till' the join might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you
Walking in the back roads
By the rivers flowing gently on my mind

I dip my cup of soup from a gurgling,
cracking cauldron in some train yard
I'm barely runnin' cold how
Have a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Who cupped hands around the tin cans
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smiling never changes on my mind
But now after loving you, what else is there to do
For honey, all the rest is just gonna have to be second best
I know I'll go through life comparing her to you
That's 'cause I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you
Your precious love cannot be erased by just another woman with a pretty face
And your memory, you know it will remain for it cannot be erased
Other loves may come along, they can't live up to you
That's 'cause I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you
Your precious love cannot be erased by just another woman with a pretty face
And your memory, you know it will remain for it cannot be erased
Other loves may come along, they can't live up to you
That's 'cause I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you
I said I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you
I said I'm no good, I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone
To anyone, to anyone, to anyone after loving you
That's 'cause I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you
How many girls choose cotton dress worlds
When they could have satins and lace
And stand by her man, never once letting shade touch her face
How many hearts could live through all the winters
We've known and still not be cold
True love travels on a gravel road.
Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger
All through streets paved with gold
For true love travels on a gravel road.
Down through the years we've had hard times and tears
But they only helped our love grow
And we'll stay together no matter how strong the wind blows
Not once have I seen your blue eyes filled with envy
Or stray from the one that you hold
Oh true love travels on a gravel road.
Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger
All through streets paved with gold
For true love travels on a gravel road.
Yeah, true love travels on a gravel road. Mmmm
True love travels on a gravel road.
True love travels on a gravel road.
[Verse 1]
Any day now I will hear you say
Goodbye my love
You'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown

[Bridge]
Any day now
(Any day now)
I'll be all alone
(I'll be all alone)

[Verse 2]
Any day now, when your restless eyes
Meet someone new, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town

[Bridge]
Any day now
(Any day now)
Love will let me down
(Love will let me down)

[Verse 3]
I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay, yeah
Until you've gone forever
I'll be holding on for dear life

[Verse 4]
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay

Any day now when the clock strikes go
You'll call it off, then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town

[Bridge]
Any day now
(Any day now, any day now)
Love will let me down
(Love will let me down)
And you won't be around
(Any day now)

[Outro]
Any day now, any day now
Don't fly away, my beautiful bird
(Any day now)
Don't fly away, my beautiful bird
(Any day now)
Any day now, don't fly away
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be
An angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Go we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round
An angry young man
Face down on the street
With a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
